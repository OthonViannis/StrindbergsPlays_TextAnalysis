    The analysis compared word frequencies between Naturalistic and Expressionist plays.
    Overall, Expressionist plays tend to have a higher frequency of emotionally charged words and symbolic language,
    reflecting the genre's focus on internal psychological states and abstract themes. Naturalistic plays, on the other hand,
    often emphasize realism and everyday language, resulting in a more balanced distribution of word frequencies.
    The highlighted words represent significant differences between the two genres, indicating potential areas of thematic divergence.
